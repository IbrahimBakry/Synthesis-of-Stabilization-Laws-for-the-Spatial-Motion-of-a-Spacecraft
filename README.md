# Synthesis-of-Stabilization-Laws-for-the-Spatial-Motion-of-a-Spacecraft
The dissertation investigates the controlled rotational motion of stabilized spacecraft (SC) with minor asymmetries during descent in the Martian atmosphere. The study focuses on synthesizing optimal control laws for simultaneous stabilization of angular velocity and spatial angle of attack
