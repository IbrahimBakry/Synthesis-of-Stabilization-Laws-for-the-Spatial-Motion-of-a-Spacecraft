**Title:** Synthesis of Stabilization Laws for the Spatial Motion of a Spacecraft with Minor Asymmetry in the Martian Atmosphere  

**Specialization:** 2.5.16 ‚Äì Dynamics, Ballistics, and Motion Control of Aircraft (Technical Sciences)  

**Research Focus:**  
The dissertation investigates the **controlled rotational motion of stabilized spacecraft (SC) with minor asymmetries** during descent in the Martian atmosphere. The study focuses on synthesizing **optimal control laws** for simultaneous stabilization of **angular velocity** and **spatial angle of attack**, ensuring alignment with the velocity vector for safe parachute deployment.

## **Key Contributions & Innovations** üéØ  
1. **Optimal Control Laws:**  
   - Developed **continuous optimal control laws** for stabilizing SC angular velocity and angle of attack, accounting for disturbances from minor aerodynamic and mass-inertial asymmetries.  
   - Derived **discrete analogs** of these laws to account for the **discrete operation of thrusters** (e.g., pulsed reaction control systems).  

2. **Resonance Avoidance Methodology:**  
   - Proposed a **novel algorithm** to estimate permissible asymmetry parameters, preventing **resonant effects** during uncontrolled descent. This expands the allowable asymmetry ranges compared to prior work.  

3. **Practical Applications:**  
   - The synthesized laws can enhance the design of **attitude control systems** for Martian landers (e.g., *Mars Polar Lander*, *InSight*, *Schiaparelli*).  
   - The asymmetry assessment method ensures mission safety in case of **control system failures**.

## **Key Findings & Impact** üåç  
- **Stabilization Performance:**  
  - The control laws reduce angular velocity and angle of attack to sensor-error levels (e.g., ‚â§0.002 rad/s, ‚â§0.004 rad) within **40 seconds** of descent.  
- **Resonance Mitigation:**  
  - The proposed asymmetry constraints prevent **main resonance** (e.g., when \( \omega \approx \Omega \)), critical for parachute deployment.  
- **Comparative Advantage:**  
  - The methodology allows **25‚Äì28% larger asymmetry tolerances** than prior approaches (e.g., Kurkina‚Äôs 2019 constraints).

## **Conclusion**  
This work advances the **autonomous control of asymmetric spacecraft** in Martian atmospheric entry, combining **theoretical rigor** (optimal control, averaging methods) with **practical applicability** (thruster discretization, asymmetry limits). The results contribute to **mission safety** for future Mars landers and low-orbit probes.
